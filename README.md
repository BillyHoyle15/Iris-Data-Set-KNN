# Iris-Data-Set-KNN
Compares two different ways to code K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (manually-coded vs scikit-learn)

In these codes, you can find two different way to create same model for famous Iris Data Set by using KNN (K-Nearest Neigbours).

First approach is from the book named "Data science from Scratch 2nd edition" by Joel Grus, all credit is belong to him, I only made small changes that I am going to explain in the file.
Second approach is using Python's scikit-learn library, coded by me.

At the end of both approaches, you'll see that same success rate is obtained.
